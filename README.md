This project aims at crafting a lifelike simulation for an ecommerce platform's online shopping
experience. The goal is to mimic user interactions, efficiently store data in both structured and
unstructured formats, and analyze behaviors for valuable insights. Real-time processing, user
segmentation, product analysis, and optional machine learning predictions are on the agenda.
